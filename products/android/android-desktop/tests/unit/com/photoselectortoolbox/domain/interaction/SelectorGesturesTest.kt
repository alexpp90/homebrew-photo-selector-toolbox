/**
 * The regression suite for the bug that started this work.
 *
 * The shipped fullscreen viewer told the user "swipe ← → navigate" while a
 * leftward swipe deleted the photograph, a rightward swipe dismissed the
 * viewer, and navigation was a vertical pager. Three of five lines on that card
 * were false. Nothing caught it, because the card was a hand-written list next
 * to bindings written elsewhere.
 *
 * These tests assert the properties that make that class of bug impossible
 * rather than just re-checking today's strings.
