/**
 * Scan and grouping queue for each other, symmetrically.
 *
 * The asymmetry these tests exist to prevent is the one recorded in
 * `ai/memory/palette.md` (2026-07-24): the desktop product queued a scan
 * requested during grouping and *disabled the control* for the mirror case. If
 * A-during-B queues, B-during-A must queue too — so every test below has a twin.
