## 🌟 The Ecosystem at a Glance

**Photo Selector Toolbox** is a privacy-first, high-velocity photo culling and metadata analysis suite designed for professional photographers, enthusiasts, and creators. Whether you are at your desktop workstation, reviewing on a tablet, or sorting on the go with your phone, we have a native solution tailored to your workflow.

> 🔒 **100% Private & Offline:** Your photos never leave your device. All EXIF parsing, duplicate detection, and quality evaluations (including local AI models) run strictly on-device. No cloud uploads, no subscriptions, no telemetry.

---

## 📦 Three Native Solutions, One Shared Repository

The repository targets three independent solutions optimized for their respective environments and UX models, while sharing high-level photographic domain concepts (like EXIF data structures and quality algorithms):

| Solution | Location | Tech Stack | Target Environment | Primary UX Paradigm |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Desktop Suite** | `src/` | Python 3.10+, Tkinter, OpenCV, rawpy | macOS, Windows, Linux | Menu & Keyboard-driven, split view |
| **Android Desktop** | `android/app/` | Kotlin, Compose, Room, OpenCV, Vico Charts | Samsung DeX, Large Tablets ($\ge 840$dp) | Mouse, Keyboard & Multi-Pane Touch |
| **Android Phone** | `android/phototok/` | Kotlin, Compose, DataStore (lightweight) | Portrait Mobile Phones ($< 600$dp) | Swipe-centric, Gesture-first ("Photo Tok") |

---

## 💻 1. Desktop Culling Suite (Python)

A full-featured Python command-line utility and custom Tkinter graphical interface optimized for high-throughput desktop curation.

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/desktop_main_app.png" alt="Desktop Application Initial Layout" width="750" style="border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); margin-bottom: 15px;" />
  <p><em>The clean, zinc-themed Desktop workspace in its initial state</em></p>
  <img src="assets/desktop_statistics.png" alt="Desktop Application Statistics Dashboard" width="750" style="border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); margin-bottom: 15px;" />
  <p><em>Interactive Library Statistics and EXIF histograms integrated into the dark theme</em></p>
</div>

### Key Features
*   **Dynamic Review Layouts:** Toggle between **Standard** mode (Current image on top, Previous/Next images side-by-side) and **Focus** mode (Current image and Controls split top, Previous/Next split bottom).
*   **Aesthetic & Quality Algorithms:**
    *   **Sharpness Score:** Crops the center 50% of the image, divides it into an 8x8 grid, and calculates the maximum block variance of the Laplacian filter.
    *   **Noise Level:** Estimates noise via Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) of the Laplacian filter:
        $$\sigma = \frac{\text{median}(|\nabla^2 I - \text{median}(\nabla^2 I)|)}{0.6745}$$
    *   **Highlight & Shadow Clipping:** Grayscale pixel thresholds highlighting blown highlights ($\ge 254$) and crushed shadows ($\le 2$).
    *   **Ollama AI Vision Integration:** Offline local VLM scoring ($1.0 - 10.0$) and analysis tags (e.g. `[ANALYSIS: Portrait]`) using base64-encoded $400 \times 400$ previews.
*   **Library Utilities:** Smart dHash-based grouping levels (Time & Filename, Fast, or Detailed) to automatically bundle burst sequences, and a SHA-256 duplicate finder with system trash fallback.
*   **ExifTool & SMB Mounting:** Bundled with ExifTool for robust raw file reading, and includes dynamic path resolvers for macOS and Linux network shares (`smb://`).

## 🖥️ 2. Android Desktop & DeX Companion

Built specifically for desktop mode environments like Samsung DeX, Chromebooks, and large-screen tablets, providing parity with the desktop culling workflow.

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/android_desktop_screenshot.png" alt="Android Desktop Layout" width="360" style="border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); margin-bottom: 15px;" />
  <p><em>Adaptive tablet layout running on Android, optimizing column viewports</em></p>
</div>

### Key Features
*   **Widescreen Viewports:** Supports a **Three-Column View** displaying Previous, Current, and Next images side-by-side in equal dimensions, as well as a **Focused View** layout.
*   **Desktop Ergonomics:** Hardware mouse pointer support (`PointerIcon.Hand` hover state) and physical keyboard shortcuts matching the desktop app (Left/Right to scroll, Backspace/Delete to trash, M/C to organize).
*   **Drag-and-Drop Imports:** Drag photo folder directories from Android file managers directly into the app window to import them instantly.
*   **SQLite Score Caching:** Persists analyzed image parameters in a local Room database with a rolling 10,000 image MRU capacity.

## 📱 3. PhotoTok Mobile Client

A lightweight, gesture-first, touch-optimized portrait client designed for quick, single-handed photo curation on your phone.

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/phototok_screenshot.png" alt="PhotoTok Mobile Interface" width="360" style="border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); margin-bottom: 15px;" />
  <p><em>Vertical TikTok-style culling with a gesture tutorial overlay and glassmorphic HUD</em></p>
</div>

### Key Features
*   **TikTok-Style Navigation:** Browse through local collections by swiping vertically up and down (`HorizontalPager` adapted to vertical scrolling).
*   **Fluid Swipes & Gestures:**
    *   **Swipe-Left to Discard:** Dragging progressive distance reveals a pulsing red trash icon, tilts the card ($2^\circ$), and fades it before executing trashing via `MediaStore`.
    *   **Double-Tap to Collect:** Instantly copies or moves the photo to your Selection folder with a bouncy green checkmark animation.
    *   **One-Tap HUD:** Single tap anywhere on screen hides/shows the glassmorphic metadata panel and controls to allow unobstructed viewing.
*   **Orientation-Aware Sorting:** Intelligently groups and sorts landscape images first, followed by portrait, or shuffles files randomly via the **Picture Randomization** settings toggle.
*   **Non-Blocking Undo:** Deletions are kept in a temporary state for 30 seconds with a quick Snackbar undo option before committing to disk or Google Drive.
