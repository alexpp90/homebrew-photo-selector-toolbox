## 2026-07-31 - On SAF, `DocumentFile` Costs One Binder Call Per Attribute, Not Per File
**Learning:** PhotoTok enumerated folders with `DocumentFile.listFiles()` and then read `name`, `length()`, `lastModified()` and `type` off each child. Every one of those getters is a separate `ContentResolver` query against the document provider, so a folder of 3 000 photos cost on the order of 15 000 binder round-trips before a single photo could be shown — and the flow emitted once, at the end, so the wait was the *whole* wait. The same shape appears with any provider-backed API whose objects are lazy proxies: the loop looks like cheap field access and is actually N×M IPC. Replacing it with one `ContentResolver.query` per directory on `DocumentsContract.buildChildDocumentsUriUsingTree`, projecting `COLUMN_DOCUMENT_ID`/`DISPLAY_NAME`/`MIME_TYPE`/`SIZE`/`LAST_MODIFIED` together and building URIs with `buildDocumentUriUsingTree`, reduces it to one query per folder.
**Action:** Never enumerate a SAF tree with `DocumentFile`; walk it iteratively (breadth-first, so deep trees cannot blow the stack) with one cursor per directory and take every attribute from that cursor. Then **stream**: emit a small first batch (~24 items) so the UI becomes usable almost immediately, then chunks, then a final snapshot — a single terminal emission converts a fast walk back into a long wait. Guard the loop with `coroutineContext.ensureActive()` and treat one unreadable directory as skippable, not fatal. Corollary for the consumer: progressive emissions must be merged **append-only** (de-duplicated against every id ever published, since the user may have removed items meanwhile), never re-sorted into the visible list.

## 2025-02-18 - String Slicing and OS Calls vs Pathlib Overheads
**Learning:** In loops over files (e.g. grouping UI lists), instantiating `pathlib.Path` objects just to call `.stem` or `p.stat().st_mtime` adds massive cumulative performance overhead compared to basic string manipulation (`name.rsplit(".", 1)[0]`) and `os.stat`. Additionally, wrapping a function in `@functools.lru_cache` provides zero benefit if the input parameter is always unique across the list iteration (e.g., unique full file names passed to `get_name_prefix`), merely adding cache management overhead.
**Action:** When working with thousands of files inside loops, bypass `pathlib` for lightweight extraction and stick to `os` and `str` methods. Always ensure that functions marked with `lru_cache` actually receive overlapping input values before adding the decorator.
## 2025-02-18 - Single-Pass Metadata Extraction in Analyzer
**Learning:** The previous implementation of `analyze_data` and `analyze_data_json` performed multiple redundant iterations over the entire dataset using list comprehensions (`get_values` with `getattr`), resulting in an O(M*N) complexity overhead.
**Action:** Replace multiple sequential loops over the same array with a single-pass extraction helper. Utilizing direct attribute access instead of `getattr` inside a single loop provides significant performance boosts when extracting attributes from hundreds of thousands of objects.
## 2025-02-18 - Batching Cache Writes during Background Analysis
**Learning:** During background UI tasks (e.g. `_preload_all_metadata_and_dhashes` or `run_calc`), executing single `cache.set_scores()` updates sequentially inside a loop over files creates an N+1 write bottleneck on the SQLite database, drastically increasing latency.
**Action:** When updating cache during iterations, use a dictionary to accumulate updates and flush them using `cache.set_multiple_scores(updates)` after the loop. Ensure that the accumulated dictionary is flushed even when breaking out of loops early (e.g. `if self.stop_event.is_set():`) to prevent silent data loss.
## 2025-02-18 - Atomic JSON Merging in SQLite Cache
**Learning:** The previous implementation of `set_scores` and `set_multiple_scores` in `ScoreCache` suffered from N+1 query patterns because it fetched existing JSON records into Python, merged them with `dict.update()`, and then wrote them back. This caused significant database I/O latency, especially for batched cache updates.
**Action:** Always use SQLite's native `json_patch()` function directly inside the `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE SET` clause. This allows for atomic merging entirely within the database engine and eliminates the need for any preliminary `SELECT` statements or client-side parsing/serialization, resulting in a ~2-3x speedup on cache writes.

## 2023-10-27 - Parallelize IO/CPU loops
**Learning:** Sequential loops containing blocking I/O (like reading EXIF via `get_exif_data`) and CPU operations (like dHash) bottleneck UI and background thread performance severely.
**Action:** Use `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` to parallelize the iteration. Define a pure worker function that returns extracted data, and use `as_completed` in the main loop to safely apply the results to the shared model, preserving GIL/thread safety.

## 2024-05-18 - Optimized list containment checks within a loop
**Learning:** Doing an O(N) list containment check (using `in`) inside an O(N) loop results in an O(N^2) operation, causing major performance bottlenecks when handling large item sets (like files in a directory).
**Action:** Always pre-convert lists to sets before using them for repeated containment checks inside loops to reduce the inner operation to O(1) and the overall complexity to O(N).


## 2025-02-18 - Path.resolve() vs os.path.abspath() Overhead
**Learning:** In Python, Path.resolve() is exceptionally slow when called in bulk loops because it hits the filesystem for stat and readlink calls to canonicalize symlinks. os.path.abspath() is significantly faster as it relies purely on string manipulation to join the path with the current working directory.
**Action:** When working with thousands of paths in performance-critical sections (like bulk caching or database operations) where strict symlink resolution isn't mandatory, always prefer os.path.abspath() over Path.resolve().

## 2024-05-18 - Regex vs Native String Methods in Tight Loops
**Learning:** When stripping specific trailing characters (like digits) from strings in performance-critical Python loops, using regular expressions (e.g., re.sub(r'\d+$', '', stem)) introduces unnecessary overhead from module loading, regex compilation, and engine execution. Replacing this with native string methods like stem.rstrip('0123456789') avoids this overhead entirely and is significantly faster.
**Action:** Always prefer native string methods (like rstrip, lstrip, split) over regular expressions for simple string manipulations inside loops where milliseconds matter.

## 2024-05-24 - Pre-computing GUI Listbox Elements
**Learning:** O(N * M) complexities easily hide in GUI render loops when item formats dynamically query grouped lists, especially during bulk insertions where listbox.insert('end', ...) uses list comprehensions.
**Action:** When inserting many items into a Tkinter listbox that require looking up properties from external grouping objects, pre-compute a lookup dictionary (O(1)) once before the loop rather than re-evaluating the group for every item (O(M)).

## 2024-05-24 - Coroutine Parallelization for I/O bounds
**Learning:** When dealing with multiple independent file operations (such as copying/moving files), executing them sequentially inside a standard for loop leaves significant performance on the table.
**Action:** Always prefer launching a kotlinx.coroutines.async block per item mapped to a list, followed by an .awaitAll() when performing a batch of independent file I/O or network requests.
