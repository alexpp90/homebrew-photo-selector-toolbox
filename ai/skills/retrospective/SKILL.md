# Retrospective — after work, before finalizing

Phase 2 of the mandatory lifecycle. Run every step. This is what makes the framework improve
itself instead of repeating its mistakes.

## 1. Tests — run the CI mirror, not a subset

Use the `verify-build` skill. In short: `./scripts/run_tests.sh` (add `--all` when an
emulator or device is attached), read the printed gate summary, and name every `⊘ SKIPPED`
gate in your task summary as an accepted risk.

Bare `pytest` or `gradlew testDebugUnitTest` is a strict subset of what CI enforces and is
**not** sufficient evidence.

**If the task is not done, the task is not done.** Never push a speculative fix and let CI
adjudicate it — a chain of `fix(ci)` / `fix(test)` commits on a branch is the anti-pattern
this step exists to prevent.

## 2. Requirements

Did observable behaviour change? Then the owning product's `REQUIREMENTS.md` changes in the
same commit. Use the `sync-requirements` skill — it covers what counts as observable, which
file owns which rule, and the workflow-parity obligation.

## 3. Reflect, then consult the mentor

Reflect on the task honestly:

- What failed on the first attempt?
- What took longest, and why?
- What surprised you — an assumption the codebase did not honour?

Draft candidate memories from that, then **consult `@shared-mentor-agent`** with the task
summary, the diff, and your candidates. The mentor is a fresh-context reviewer: it dedupes
against existing memory, rejects task-diary noise, routes each candidate to the right home,
and writes the final wording.

**Do not write to `ai/memory/` or to a playbook without this gate.** Working agents are
biased toward memorizing their own struggle; the two-phase commit is what keeps memory sharp.

In tools without subagents, adopt `ai/agents/shared-mentor-agent.md` as a role in a separate
reflection pass, or file candidates tagged `[PROPOSED]`.

If nothing at all was learned you may skip the consult — but say so explicitly in your summary.

## 4. Lessons

What the mentor approves gets written via the `record-lesson` skill, which owns the file
routing, the dated `Learning`/`Action` format, and the dedupe rules.

## 5. Refactoring candidates

Saw debt you could not fix in scope — duplication, dead code, pattern violations, oversized
functions? Add a backlog entry to `ai/memory/code_health.md` with file paths and rationale.
**Do not silently drop it.**

Large refactorings (multi-file, cross-module) are not retro side effects. File them and let
`@shared-code-health-agent` schedule them as dedicated tasks.

## 6. Framework drift

If any agent instruction, scope, skill or routing rule was wrong or stale during this task,
fix it now at the canonical source under `ai/` and regenerate what depends on it. Use the
`sync-framework` skill — it owns the regeneration and validation steps.

A stale instruction you noticed and did not fix will cost the next agent the same time it
cost you.

## 7. Playbook

Is this task type likely to recur? Use the `create-playbook` skill to record the efficient
path, or to improve the playbook you followed. Playbooks must get better every time they are
used.

## 8. Hygiene

No scratch files, report dumps, or PR-description drafts staged for commit. Benchmarks belong
in `products/desktop/benchmarks/`, never in the repository root. The `guard-paths` hook blocks
most of these at write time, but check `git status` before you finish.

## Checklist

```

[ ] 4. Approved lessons written via record-lesson
[ ] 5. Out-of-scope debt filed in ai/memory/code_health.md
[ ] 6. Framework drift fixed at source and validated
[ ] 7. Playbook created or improved (or: task type will not recur)
[ ] 8. git status clean of scratch artifacts
