# Documentation

Documentation is organised by **product**, using the same slugs as the code. Every file
states at the top which product it governs. If a file would need to say "except on PhotoTok",
it belongs in [`shared/`](shared/) or it belongs in two files.

Start with the [Glossary](GLOSSARY.md) — the three products have accumulated several names
each, and using the wrong one is how a change lands in the wrong app.

## The repository in one screen

```
products/                   ALL product code. One directory per product, same shape in each.
  desktop/                    src/ tests/ benchmarks/ scripts/ pyproject.toml
  android/                    Gradle build root for both Android products
    android-desktop/          src/ tests/ res/ AndroidManifest.xml build.gradle.kts
    phototok/                 src/ tests/ res/ AndroidManifest.xml build.gradle.kts
    core/                     src/ build.gradle.kts   (the only shared Android code)
docs/                       This tree — product documentation
ai/                         Agent framework: routing, agents, skills, memory
scripts/                    Cross-product tooling (run_tests.sh — the local CI mirror)
assets/                     Shared branding
Formula/  Casks/            Homebrew tap definitions (must stay at the root)
.github/                    CI workflows
```

Code slug ↔ docs slug:

| Product | Code | Docs |
|---|---|---|
| Desktop | `products/desktop/` | [`products/desktop/`](products/desktop/) |
| Android Desktop | `products/android/android-desktop/` | [`products/android-desktop/`](products/android-desktop/) |
| PhotoTok | `products/android/phototok/` | [`products/phototok/`](products/phototok/) |
| *(shared Android code)* | `products/android/core/` | [`shared/`](shared/) |

## Map of this tree

```
docs/
  README.md            This file
  GLOSSARY.md          Canonical product names, slugs, modules, packages

  products/
    desktop/           Desktop — Python + Tkinter
      README.md          What it is, how to run it, where the code lives
      REQUIREMENTS.md    Authoritative behaviour spec
      ARCHITECTURE.md    Package layout and layering rules
    android-desktop/   Android Desktop — :android-desktop, tablets and DeX
      README.md
      REQUIREMENTS.md    Authoritative behaviour spec
      ARCHITECTURE.md    Layers, adaptive layout, performance, theme implementation
      DESIGN.md          Visual specification (layout maths, tokens, component sheet)
      DESIGN_PROMPT.md   Design-tool brief derived from DESIGN.md
    phototok/          PhotoTok — :phototok, phones
      README.md
      REQUIREMENTS.md    Authoritative behaviour spec, incl. architecture conventions
      ARCHITECTURE.md    Theme and structural notes
      DESIGN.md          Visual specification

  shared/              Rules that must hold for MORE THAN ONE product
    README.md            What is shared, what is deliberately not, and the admission rule
    ANDROID_PLATFORM.md  Android baseline both Android products obey (EXIF, storage, stack)
    FEATURE_PARITY.md    Feature sync policy, permanent exclusions, desktop → Android mapping

  build/               How the products are built, signed and shipped
    CI_PARITY.md                 What runs where and why; local mirror vs GitHub Actions
    ANDROID_BUILD_AND_RELEASE.md Gradle, CI, artifacts, distribution
    ANDROID_SIGNING_PLAN.md      Rationale for per-app cloud/signing isolation
    ANDROID_SIGNING_SETUP.md     Step-by-step setup instructions
    ANDROID_SIGNING_RUNBOOK.md   Operational runbook for the isolation migration
```

The agent framework is **not** documentation and does not live here — it is in
[`../ai/`](../ai/README.md).

## Which file do I edit?

| I changed… | Edit |
|---|---|
| Desktop behaviour | `products/desktop/REQUIREMENTS.md` |
| Android Desktop behaviour | `products/android-desktop/REQUIREMENTS.md` |
| PhotoTok behaviour | `products/phototok/REQUIREMENTS.md` |
| Android Desktop visuals | `products/android-desktop/DESIGN.md` |
| PhotoTok visuals | `products/phototok/DESIGN.md` |
| Something both Android products must obey | `shared/ANDROID_PLATFORM.md` |
| Whether a feature crosses products | `shared/FEATURE_PARITY.md` |
| A CI gate | `build/CI_PARITY.md` **and** `scripts/run_tests.sh` **and** the workflow, in one commit |
| Signing, secrets, store publishing | `build/ANDROID_BUILD_AND_RELEASE.md` |
| How agents are routed | `../ai/ROUTING.md` |
| The directory layout itself | `../products/README.md` (the rules) and this file (the map) |

## Known gaps

- **Desktop has no visual design document.** Its UI is specified inside
  `products/desktop/REQUIREMENTS.md` § 3 (layout constraints, display modes, dark theme), which
  is a requirements file doing a design file's job. The two Android products each have a proper
  `DESIGN.md`; Desktop should get one.
- **`products/phototok/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` does not exist yet.** The publish agent treats it
  as the single source of truth for open release tasks, alongside the privacy policy and
  Impressum sources. It must be written before the next store submission.
