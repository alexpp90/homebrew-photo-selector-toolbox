# Linux Desktop

High-performance native GNOME photo selection and comparison culling application built in Python 3.12+,
PyGObject, GTK4, and Libadwaita for Debian 13 (Trixie) and GNOME 46+. Designed specifically for
lightning-fast SD-card photo ingestion, large-scale RAW/JPEG triage, native Libadwaita look-and-feel,
and seamless Debian APT package distribution.

## Architecture & Layering

The product is partitioned into a clean modular architecture following the repository's uniform product layout:

1. **Optical & Metadata Extraction Layer**:
   - Parses EXIF/TIFF tags, camera profiles, and orientation without UI thread blocking.
   - Computes Laplacian focus variance metrics for sharpness assessment.
   - Manages RAW + JPEG sibling file linking.

2. **Culling Workspace & Transactional Operations**:
   - Manages photo queues, 1-Up, 2-Up, and 3-Up comparison viewports.
   - Transactional file routing (`Selection/`, Trash) with instant feedback and undo support.

3. **GNOME HIG / Libadwaita Presentation Layer**:
   - Modern Libadwaita window with `AdwHeaderBar`, dark styling conforming to GNOME HIG.
   - Zero-latency keyboard shortcuts (`←`/`→`, `h`/`l`, `M`, `C`, `Delete`).

4. **Debian APT Packaging**:
   - In-repo `debian/` packaging definitions producing `.deb` binaries.
   - APT repository structure for Debian 13 (Trixie) distribution.

## Relationship to the Other Products

Linux Desktop is an independent Python / GTK4 / Libadwaita implementation. It shares photographic concepts (the EXIF contract, quality score semantics, what "Selection" means) with Desktop, macOS Desktop, Android Desktop, and PhotoTok, but shares no implementation code:

- **Distinct from legacy Python Desktop (`products/desktop/`)**: Modern Libadwaita / GTK4 architecture replacing Tkinter, custom dark theme, and PyInstaller with native GNOME HIG and Debian APT packaging.
- **Distinct from macOS Desktop (`products/macos-desktop/`)**: Pure GNOME desktop experience tailored to Debian 13 and FreeDesktop standards rather than macOS AppKit/SwiftUI.
- See [`../../shared/FEATURE_PARITY.md`](../../shared/FEATURE_PARITY.md).

## Not in This Product

- No Tkinter, PyInstaller, or Ollama server dependencies (legacy Desktop-only).
- No Apple Vision or Accelerate vImage frameworks (macOS-exclusive).
- No Android Storage Access Framework (SAF), Jetpack Compose, or Room database.
