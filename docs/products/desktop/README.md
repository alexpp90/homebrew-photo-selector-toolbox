# Desktop

Python + Tkinter culling suite for macOS, Linux and Windows workstations. The most complete
of the three products: it has the CLI, the statistics plots, the duplicate finder and the only
local-VLM aesthetic scoring.

## Run from source

```bash
poetry install
poetry run photo-selector-gui          # GUI
poetry run photo-selector-toolbox ...  # CLI
```

## Test

```bash
./scripts/run_tests.sh                 # the CI mirror — use this
pytest                                 # subset only; not sufficient evidence
```

GUI tests need a display; on headless Linux use `xvfb-run`. Visual regression tests are marked
`visual` and are Linux-only — see [`../../build/CI_PARITY.md`](../../build/CI_PARITY.md).

## Not in this product

Local AI aesthetic evaluation via Ollama is Desktop-only, but the reverse exclusions matter
too: the gesture feed, SAF storage and adaptive window size classes belong to the Android
products and have no Desktop equivalent. See
[`../../shared/FEATURE_PARITY.md`](../../shared/FEATURE_PARITY.md).
